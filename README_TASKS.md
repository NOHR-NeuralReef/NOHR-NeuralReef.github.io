- [x] Read and understand all existing files thoroughly before making any changes
  - [x] Analyzed package.json dependencies and structure
  - [x] Analyzed home.component.ts implementation
  - [x] Documented current functionality
- [ ] Create backup branch of current working version
- [ ] Run full test suite to establish baseline functionality

## First Verifiable Step

```bash
git checkout -b backup/pre-angular19-upgrade
git add .
git commit -m "chore: backup before Angular 19 upgrade"
```

npm install
ng build
ng serve
```

3. Run Tests:
```bash
ng test
ng e2e
```

- [ ] Convert to standalone components architecture
